Don't forgets:
- interactive value editor
- "drag to pan and scroll to zoom"
- big table
- note that it's a histogram!
- smooth transitions?
- wide enough slider
- give gaussian hard outline and no/v-opaque bars
- second distribution? a real one? which?
- note x-axis is log2, possibly do both axes same way?
- max zoom level?
- e7m2fn bug
- toggling visibility can break correct ordering
