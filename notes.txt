Don't forgets:
- interactive value editor
- "drag to pan and scroll to zoom"
- big table
- note that it's a histogram!
- smooth transitions?
- pan accom gaussian, but always have sensible range (& wide enough slider)
- give gaussian hard outline and no/v-opaque bars
- second distribution? a real one? which?
